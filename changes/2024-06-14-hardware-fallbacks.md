# Hardware acceleration fallbacks update

## Summary
- Replaced `hardware_accelerated_processing` module with `SafeHardwareAccelerator` implementation.
- Added resilient detection of system capabilities with psutil, torch, CuPy, and Numba fallbacks.
- Implemented explicit backend tests and graceful CPU fallbacks for XOR and embedding operations.
- Introduced safe parallel chunk processing and streaming helpers with detailed error handling.
- Exposed `setup_optimal_hardware` to maintain compatibility with existing production code.

## Rationale
This change improves reliability across diverse hardware setups by verifying GPU availability,
providing clear warnings on failure, and ensuring a CPU implementation always exists. The module
now handles missing optional dependencies more gracefully and offers memory-aware processing options.
